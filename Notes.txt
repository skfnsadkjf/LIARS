			-----------------
			----- Plans -----

When searching for tags when sorting split multiword tags.
Allow searching of more than one tag at a time. I.E. searching for "cat girl" would give first "cat girl" then "cat"/"girl".

sort by tag with named sections.

Colour code entries based on tags/complete status.

Change browser action to open page when clicked. (remove menu)

			----- Current -----


			----- Required -----

---- add wait to start to prevent it messing with things it shouldn't on startup.

---- Don't update complete/oneshot manga. Maybe unstarted too.

Double click remove tag/entry to remove. Don't want to accidently remove tags/entries.
	Maybe draw a red cross after first click to indicate what's being removed.
	Or, add a red border to what's being deleted, because it's super easy and probs looks nicer.

if sort is a binary split, insert gap. And title of gap.

Work out why it doesn't close tabs sometimes.

			----- Extra features -----

Add image identifier. Does it make it too cluttered?
	would need entries side by side.
	image source in rule.
		save images somewhere. Unsure how logistics would work.

			----- Optional -----

Import data from Feedreader and text file.

			----- Relating to using not just kissmanga -----

rules:
	merge option for multiple urls into one content page entry

Do rss stuff in background
Do I care about rss yet? No.

make option for using GET or opening a tab to check listings.
Maybe in option's rules.

Maybe save whole element instead of just links.
May be helpful for things like blog updates where saving links wouldn't be meaningful.

			-----------------
			----- Bugs -----

Error: "Attempt to postMessage on disconnected port"
After checking manga listing. Tab doesn't get closed because of this.


first sort in default reversed if sorting from first default.


Either addon or firefox is borking my tabs sometimes. Hasn't happened it ages now

			-----------------
			----- Notes -----


Can't GET a kissmanga page.
Possible fix if I into headers.
Can't into headers because ff forbids me from changing them. <--
