			-----------------
			----- Plans -----

			----- Current -----

			----- Required -----

			----- Extra features -----

DOM elelent selector.
	browser action popup:
		contain all options for making rule.
		? icons with instructions

	arrow keys traverse dom selector.

rules:
	merge option for multiple urls into one content page entry

Options page.
	update minimum
	How often to check for update settings.
		Change this to options/rules

if sort is a binary split, insert gap.

			----- Optional -----

hotkeys for browser action things

Add image identifier. Does it make it too cluttered?
	would need entries side by side.
	image source in rule.
		save images somewhere. Unsure how logistics would work.

Import data from Feedreader and text file.

			----- Relating to using not just kissmanga -----


Do rss stuff in background
Do I care about rss yet? No.

make option for using GET or opening a tab to check listings.
Maybe in option's rules.

Maybe save whole element instead of just links.
May be helpful for things like blog updates where saving links wouldn't be meaningful.

			-----------------
			----- Bugs -----

first sort in default reversed if sorting from first default.


Either addon or firefox is borking my tabs sometimes. Hasn't happened it ages now

			-----------------
			----- Notes -----


Can't GET a kissmanga page.
Possible fix if I into headers.
Can't into headers because ff forbids me from changing them. <--
