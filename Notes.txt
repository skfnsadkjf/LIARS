			----- Plans -----

			----- Required -----

			----- Extra features -----

if sort is a binary split, insert gap. And title of gap.

Double click remove tag/entry to remove. Don't want to accidently remove tags/entries.
	Maybe draw a red cross after first click to indicate what's being removed.
	Or, add a red border to what's being deleted, because it's super easy and probs looks nicer.

Colour code entries based on tags/complete status.

Add image identifier. Does it make it too cluttered?
	would need entries side by side.
	image source in rule.
		save images somewhere. Unsure how logistics would work.

			----- Optional -----

			----- Relating to using not just kissmanga -----

rules:
	merge option for multiple urls into one content page entry

Do rss stuff in background
Do I care about rss yet? No.

make option for using GET or opening a tab to check listings.
Maybe in option's rules.

Maybe save whole element instead of just links.
May be helpful for things like blog updates where saving links wouldn't be meaningful.

			-----------------
			----- Bugs -----

Capitalisation differences in urls can bork everything.

Error: "Attempt to postMessage on disconnected port"
After checking manga listing. Tab doesn't get closed because of this.

			-----------------
			----- Notes -----


Can't GET a kissmanga page.
Possible fix if I into headers.
Can't into headers because ff forbids me from changing them. <--
